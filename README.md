In the realm of computer vision, real-time object detection and identification play pivotal
roles in enabling instant and accurate perception of the surrounding environment. This project
titled "Real-Time Vision" employs the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model and OpenCV
framework to achieve real-time object detection. The project leverages live video feeds from
a camera to detect multiple objects simultaneously, annotating them with bounding boxes and
class labels in milliseconds. By integrating advanced deep learning techniques with efficient
processing capabilities, the system demonstrates robust performance across various
applications such as surveillance, autonomous systems, and retail analytics. This initiative
marks significant strides in enhancing operational efficiency, security measures, and
interactive technologies in the field of real-time computer vision.
